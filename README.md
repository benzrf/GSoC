## Celluloid in the Google Summer of Code

> Painless multi-threaded multi-core programming for Ruby.

Multi-core multi-threaded programming can drive you insane. But with Celluloid, coders create high-performance parallel, asynchronous, concurrent, even distributed systems: simply.

## Students:

* Check out our **[Ideas List](https://github.com/celluloid/GSoC/wiki/Ideas-List)**.

* Read our [Proposal Guidelines](https://github.com/celluloid/GSoC/blob/master/proposals_guidelines.md).

* Find out where we [communicate](https://github.com/celluloid/GSoC/wiki/Communication).

* **Browse our repositories:**
  * [Celluloid][1]

## Mentors:

Prepare to give several hours per week to help students learn to participate in Open Source, by making contributions to Celluloid. The number of hours per week varies by student, but it can range anywhere from 1-3 to 5-10 depending on the student, and depending on your own availability.

This year we are providing mentor support, so if you are unable to do more hours in a given week and a student needs more help to stay on track -- you can rely on other mentors to help.

The overall program is for 12-weeks, during the Summer. The relationships formed with students can last their entire career, and there might not be a better way to improve yourself, as not just a coder -- but as a person. It is a truly rewarding experience.
